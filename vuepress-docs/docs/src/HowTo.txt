HowTo edit DIA documentation in VuePress

GENERAL USE
All content can be edited using markdown: https://markdown-it.github.io/
This is the markdown renderer VuePress uses, with more documentation: https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it
For VuePress, there is a great documentation here: https://v1.vuepress.vuejs.org/

On top of that, there are only a few special things that are important, basically about navigation and custom components:

NAVIGATION
For now there are three navigation elements:

Header-Navigatin and Side Bar Navigation
Both are in "vuepress-docs/vuepress-docs/docs/src/.vuepress/config.js"
- Header: themeConfig.nav
- Sidebar: themeConfig.sidebar

CAUTION: editing is tricky, especially the sidebar needs to be handled with care. 

Footer
TODO: For now, we work with the component "ComponentFooter.vue" as a reusable footer, as "slots" dont seem to work (need to be re-defined in every markdown file). This should be re-considered, we should check the templating feature for that. For usage of components see below

---

STYLING
CSS can be applied individually but should rather be implemented either globally (in vuepress-docs/vuepress-docs/docs/src/.vuepress/styles) or for re-used components, see below


---

COMPONENTS
Components are used for content elements which are not provided by markdown by default, for example for displaying sources / exchanges with logos, text, dynamic content etc
CAUTION: VuePress comes with many components and plugins which have not been tried out during first setup, so before coding our own check if what we need is out there

To examine how basic feature work we provide sample components in vuepress-docs/vuepress-docs/docs/src/.vuepress/components

HOW TO USE COMPONENTS
There are two samples:
- Sample component with "rich text content" (aka MarkDown Content)
Just add the following to your markdown:
<SampleComponentMarkdownContent>

### Example component with markdown content 
- Any markdown
- you put here
> will be slotted in 

</SampleComponentMarkdownContent>

- Sample component with Javascript execution and parameter content (only strings)
Just add the following to your markdown:

<SampleComponentJavascriptExecution display-text="parameter for button label" headlineText="parameter for headline" />
TODO: The sample component shows how javascript in components is executed and it also shows how parameter are passed to the component. However, passing a parameter to javascript execution is not implemented for now - there are many examples for that in the VuePress documentation tho
