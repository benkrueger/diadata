HowTo edit DIA documentation in VuePress

GENERAL USE
All content can be edited using markdown: https://markdown-it.github.io/
This is the markdown renderer VuePress uses, with more documentation: https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it
For VuePress, there is a great documentation here: https://v1.vuepress.vuejs.org/

On top of that, there are only a few special things that are important, basically about navigation and custom components:

NAVIGATION
For now there are three navigation elements:

Header-Navigatin and Side Bar Navigation
Both are in "vuepress-docs/vuepress-docs/docs/src/.vuepress/config.js"
- Header: themeConfig.nav
- Sidebar: themeConfig.sidebar

CAUTION: editing is tricky, especially the sidebar needs to be handled with care. 

Footer
See "vuepress-docs/vuepress-docs/docs/src/index.md", there: ::: slot footer
TODO: the footer does not appear on all pages, check why

---

STYLING
CSS can be applied individually but should rather be implemented either globally (in vuepress-docs/vuepress-docs/docs/src/.vuepress/styles) or for re-used components, see below
TODO: changes in vuepress-docs/vuepress-docs/docs/src/.vuepress/styles/index.styl don't seem to have an effect

---

COMPONENTS
Components are used for content elements which are not provided by markdown by default, for example for displaying sources / exchanges with logos, text, dynamic content etc
CAUTION: VuePress comes with many components and plugins which have not been tried out during first setup, so before coding our own check if what we need is out there

To examine how basic feature work we provide sample components in vuepress-docs/vuepress-docs/docs/src/.vuepress/components
