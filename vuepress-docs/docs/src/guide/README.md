## What is DIA? 

__DIA (Decentralised Information Asset) is a cross-chain, end-to-end, open-source data and oracle platform for Web3.__
The DIA platform enables the sourcing, validation and sharing of transparent and verified data feeds for traditional and digital financial applications. DIA’s institutional-grade data feeds cover asset prices, metaverse data, lending rates and more.
DIA’s data is directly sourced from a broad array of on-chain and off-chain sources at individual a trade-level. This allows DIA feeds to be fully customised with regards to the mix of sources and methodologies, resulting in tailor-made, high resilience feeds, setting a new paradigm for oracles.

Do we really render README.md? 
Yes we do ;)


Each page generated by VuePress has its own pre-rendered static HTML, providing great loading performance and is SEO-friendly. Once the page is loaded, however, Vue takes over the static content and turns it into a full Single-Page Application (SPA). Additional pages are fetched on demand as the user navigates around the site.
